        "a": "<b>No, a V30 card is sufficient for the Avata 2's maximum bitrate.</b> However, using a V60 or V90 card will significantly speed up the process of transferring files from the card to your computer, which can save time given the large file sizes."

        "a": "<b>The SD card slot is located inside the USB-C port cover on the side of the drone.</b> Unlike the first generation Avata (where it was hard to reach inside the duct), the Avata 2 slot is much more accessible."
