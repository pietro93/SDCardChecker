          "q": "Can the Kingston Workflow Station really transfer 4 cards simultaneously?",
          "a": "Yes. Four modular mini-hubs read SD/CFexpress cards simultaneously at full UHS-II speeds (300+ MB/s per slot). Four 64GB cards offload in ~12 minutes total."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does the Kingston Workflow Station need external power?",
          "a": "USB-C provides power for data only. External 12V power recommended for sustained multi-card transfers. Without external power, transfers are slower but still work via USB-C alone."
        },

          "q": "Are the Kingston mini-hubs modular and field-portable?",

          "q": "Is the $350 Kingston Workflow Station worth it for professional photographers?",
