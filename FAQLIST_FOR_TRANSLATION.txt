FAQ ITEMS FOR TRANSLATION - GoPro Hero 13 Black (START HERE - 3 ITEMS)
===============================================================================

DEVICE: GoPro Hero 13 Black
SOURCE: data/devices-ja.json

---

ITEM 1:
Q: Can I use a full-size SD card with an adapter?
A: <b>No, the GoPro Hero 13 Black only accepts microSD cards.</b> Full-size SD cards will not work even with an adapter. The camera's card slot is specifically designed for microSD format only.

---

ITEM 2:
Q: What's the fastest microSD card for the Hero 13?
A: <b>The fastest cards available are rated for up to 300 MB/s read speeds.</b> However, the Hero 13 has limited internal write speeds, so you won't see the full speed of ultra-premium cards. V30 cards with 60+ MB/s write speeds are more than sufficient and offer the best value.

---

ITEM 3:
Q: Can I use cards older than 5 years?
A: <b>Older microSD cards may work, but we don't recommend them.</b> Cards manufactured 5+ years ago may have degraded performance, and some may not be compatible with the Hero 13's firmware. For reliability, use cards manufactured within the last 2-3 years.

FAQ ITEMS FOR TRANSLATION - Nintendo Switch (3 ITEMS)
===============================================================================

DEVICE: Nintendo Switch
SOURCE: data/devices-ja.json

---

ITEM 1:
Q: What SD Card Do I Need for Nintendo Switch?
A: The Nintendo Switch requires a microSD, microSDHC, or microSDXC card. We recommend microSDXC for maximum compatibility and capacity. Speed class V30 is sufficient for game storage and downloads. Any major brand works: SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston, or Lexar.

---

ITEM 2:
Q: Do I need microSDXC or microSDHC?
A: <b>microSDXC is the better choice</b> if you plan to store many games or install multiple titles at once. microSDHC (up to 32GB) can work but fills up quickly. microSDXC cards (64GB, 128GB, 256GB) provide more flexibility for your game library.

---

ITEM 3:
Q: How can I transfer games to a new SD card?
A: <b>You can transfer data directly between SD cards using the Switch's Data Management tool.</b> Insert both the old and new card into a computer, use the Switch's archive/unarchive feature for cloud saves, or manually copy the Nintendo folder to the new card. No game reinstallation needed.
