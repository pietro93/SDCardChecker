### Sprint 2: Page Optimization (Content + Images)
- **Owner:** Amp + You
- **Timeline:** Nov 19-26 (parallel with additions)
- **Target:** Optimize 5-8 high-potential pages

**Phase 1: Identify High-Potential Pages (Nov 19)**
Using GSC data, prioritize by:
1. **High impressions + 0% CTR** (content/format issue)
   - Sony FX3 (33 impr)
   - DJI Mini 4K (29 impr)
   - Canon G7X Mark III (17 impr)
   
2. **Medium impressions + low CTR** (optimization opportunity)
   - DJI Osmo Pocket 3 (43 impr, 2.33%)
   - Sony A6700 (46 impr, 0%)

3. **High CTR but needs image** (quick win)
   - Lenovo Legion Go (48 impr, 2.08% - check image status)
   - Nikon Z50 II (9 impr, 11.11%)
   - Leica Q2 (7 impr, 14.29%)

**Phase 2: Audit & Optimize (Nov 20-26)**
For each high-potential page:
- [ ] Review page structure (compare winners vs non-converters)
- [ ] Check hero image status (add only if high-potential)
- [ ] Audit first FAQ answer (is it scannable? Matches query intent?)
- [ ] Verify specs are prominent/clear
- [ ] Check for broken Amazon links
- [ ] Deploy + monitor CTR changes

**Success Metric:** +0.5-1% CTR improvement on optimized pages

---

### Sprint 3: Long-Form Content Strategy
- **Owner:** Amp (planning) + You (approval/input)
- **Timeline:** Nov 19-26 (planning), Dec 1+ (execution)
- **Scope:** Define content roadmap for Mediavine + better ad monetization

**Phase 1: Keyword Research (Nov 19-21)**
Research high-volume, low-competition keywords in:
1. **Comparison guides** ("best sd card for [device A] vs [device B]")
2. **Speed class guides** ("what is V90 sd card", "UHS-II explained")
3. **Brand guides** ("best sd cards by brand" - SanDisk, Kingston, etc.)
4. **Use case guides** ("4K video sd card specs", "gaming handheld sd card requirements")

**Deliverable:** Content calendar with 5-10 target articles + estimated effort

**Phase 2: Template & First Draft (Nov 22-26)**
- Create long-form content template (2000-3000 words, SEO-optimized)
- Write 1-2 pilot pieces to test format
- Iterate based on initial GSC performance

**Examples to explore:**
- "Best SD Cards for 4K Video (Under $X)" - targets video content creators
- "Lenovo Legion Go vs Steam Deck: Which SD Card?" - targets gaming audience
- "Understanding UHS-II vs UHS-I" - targets technical searchers
- "SanDisk vs Kingston vs Lexar: SD Card Comparison" - brand comparison

## 🚨 BACKLOG (Monitor, Don't Act Yet)

### Language Localization Strategy (Month 6+)
- **Status:** Not ready yet - focus on English authority first
- **High-Value Markets Identified:**
  - 🇯🇵 **Japan** - MASSIVE search volume, monetization blocker (need Rakuten or Journey-only solution)
  - 🇸🇪 **Sweden** - HIGH volume, Mediavine + OneLink available, smallest effort for ROI
  - 🇳🇱 **Dutch** - HIGH volume, Mediavine + OneLink available, smallest effort for ROI
  - 🇩🇪 German - HIGH volume, established market, good monetization
- **Action:** Monitor GSC for Japan, Sweden, Netherlands search volume patterns. If consistent high traffic (100+ impressions/week), plan Swedish translation by Month 6.
- **Timeline:** Phase 2 (Month 6-9) = Swedish/Dutch, Phase 3 (Month 9-12) = German, Phase 4 (Month 12+) = Japanese
- **Reference:** See GSC_ANALYSIS.md "LANGUAGE LOCALIZATION STRATEGY" section

### Old Category Page Redirects
- **Status:** Identified in GSC (10+ old URLs still appearing)
- **Examples:** `/categories/action-cameras/dji-osmo-pocket-3/`, `/categories/gaming-handhelds/`
- **Action:** Verify if these need 301 redirects or if they're properly canonicalized
- **Timeline:** Nov 22 (after device additions complete)

### Brand Category Pages
- **Idea:** "Best SD Cards for GoPro", "Best SD Cards for DJI", "Best SD Cards for Canon"
- **Trigger to act:** Only if GSC shows brand-level queries (not device-specific)
- **Current signal:** No brand-level queries observed yet
- **Next review:** Nov 25
