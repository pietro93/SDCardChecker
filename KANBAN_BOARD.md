## 🔧 ACTIVE WORK (Do This Week)

### KANBAN-9 | Affiliate Link Audit & Testing
- **Status:** PENDING - High priority, quick win
- **Owner:** You
- **Deadline:** This week (Nov 14-21)
- **Effort:** ~1-2 hours (spread over a few days)
- **Why:** You're already getting affiliate clicks. Making sure all 200+ links work = protecting revenue.
- **What to do:**
  - [ ] Test the 3 untested affiliate links (click each one, verify Amazon redirect works)
  - [ ] Spot-check 10 random affiliate links from your site (are they going to the right product?)
  - [ ] If any are broken: note them and fix
  - [ ] Document the testing (simple text log: "Tested 13 links Nov 14, all working")
- **Success Criteria:** All tested links redirect correctly; zero dead links found

---

### KANBAN-8 | Device Database Expansion (Phase 2)
- **Status:** PENDING - High priority, longer timeline
- **Owner:** You
- **Deadline:** Ongoing (target: 10-15 new devices/week)
- **Why:** 34 devices is your current ceiling. Each new device = potential new Google keyword = potential new affiliate click.
- **Strategy:**
  - Start adding devices **next week** once you've tested affiliate links
  - Prioritize based on search volume + competitor gaps
  - Aim for 50+ new pages by Dec 15
- **Research categories (pick one to start):**
  - Gaming: Switch OLED, PS5, Xbox Series X, Steam Deck
  - Cameras: Sony A6400, Canon EOS R6, GoPro, action cams
  - Phones: iPhones with expandable SD, Android flagships (Pixel, Samsung)
  - Tablets: iPad Pro, Android tablets
  - Automotive: Dashcams (huge market), car headunits
- **Process per device:**
  - Research official specs (max capacity, speed class, card type)
  - Create device page (reuse existing template + schema)
  - Test page renders correctly
  - Deploy
  - Estimate: 20-30 min per device once you dial in the process
- **Next step:** Pick one category to research this week. Don't add yet—just identify 10 devices you want to target.

## 🟡 DEFERRED (60+ Days - Revisit in January)

### KANBAN-1 | Phase 2 UX Features (Filtering/Sorting)
- **Status:** Deferred
- **Reason:** Low ROI pre-revenue. Only build if Analytics shows users bouncing because they can't find things.
- **Revisit condition:** When you have 4+ weeks of traffic data showing a clear pattern.

---

### KANBAN-5 | Device Comparison Feature
- **Status:** Deferred
- **Reason:** SEO-driven users don't need comparison tools. They want one answer: "What SD card should I buy for my device?"
- **Revisit condition:** If Analytics shows 10%+ of users visiting 2+ device pages in one session (indicates they're comparing).

---

### KANBAN-10 | Code Quality & Performance Audit
- **Status:** Deferred
- **Reason:** Lighthouse already at 90+. Not a bottleneck.
- **Revisit condition:** If Google Core Web Vitals report shows issues, or users complain about speed.

└─ Adjust device targets based on what's getting impressions

WEEK 7-12 (Dec 15 - Jan 30)
├─ Continue device expansion based on data

├─ Review: Should we pivot or go deeper?
└─ Plan Phase 3 (only if data supports it)
```

## 🔥 WEEKLY ROUTINE (Starting Nov 21)

**Every Friday morning (10 min):**
1. Open GSC → click "Performance" → note total impressions
2. Open Amazon Associates dashboard → note total affiliate clicks
3. Update tracking spreadsheet: Date | Impressions | Clicks | Notes
4. Look for patterns (which device pages are getting impressions?)

**That's it.** Not overthinking it yet.

---

## 💭 REALITY CHECK

You shipped. You got users. You got affiliate clicks in 72 hours.

Your job now:
1. **Don't break it.** (Test those 3 links, make sure all links work)
2. **Watch it.** (Weekly GSC + Amazon check)
3. **Feed it.** (Add more devices based on what gets impressions)

Everything else is noise.

---

**Next Steps:** 
1. Test those 3 affiliate links this week
2. Spend 30 min researching one device category you want to target
3. Report back when you're ready to start adding devices
