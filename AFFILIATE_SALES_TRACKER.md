## 🔧 Tracking Improvements Needed

### Critical: Add UTM Parameters to Links
Currently unable to track which device pages drive conversions.

**Action:** Update all affiliate links to include UTM parameters:
```
https://amazon.com/s?k=ProGrade+SDXC&tag=sd-cc-20&utm_source=sdcardchecker&utm_medium=device-page&utm_campaign=device-name
```

**Parameters to track:**
- `utm_source` = sdcardchecker
- `utm_medium` = device-page | tool-page | guide | calculator
- `utm_campaign` = Device name (e.g., "canon-r6-mark-ii", "gopro-hero-13")

### Implementation
1. Add UTM builder to link generation system
2. Update all 98+ device pages with unique UTM codes
3. Track in Google Analytics 4 → Conversions → Source

### Dashboard Items to Monitor
- [ ] Which device pages drive most conversions?
- [ ] Device vs Tool vs Guide conversion rates
- [ ] Average order value by category
- [ ] Return rate (if available from Amazon)

## 💼 Affiliate Network Status

### Active Networks
| Network | Status | Commission Rate | Volume |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Amazon Associates | ✅ Active | 2.5%-3% | High |
| K&F Concept | ✅ Active | 4% | Low (direct) |
| OneLink | ⏳ Pending | Varies | Not yet used |
| Mediavine | 🔴 N/A | N/A | Ad network, not affiliate |

### Next Steps
1. **Monitor K&F Concept conversion rates** - 4% rate makes this attractive
2. **Test other affiliate networks** - Camera gear (B&H Photo affiliate program)
3. **Negotiate higher rates** - Once traffic increases, approach Amazon for higher tier

## 🔍 Nov 21 Analysis

**Pattern Observed:** Users clicking affiliate links → arriving at Amazon → browsing other categories → purchasing unrelated items

**Implication:** 
- ✅ Affiliate links are driving traffic and purchases
- ⚠️ Only 1 of 2 new clicks (Nov 21) resulted in SD card purchase
- ⚠️ Need to optimize product selection or link strategy

**Next Action:** Monitor if >30% of affiliate sales are unrelated items. If so, consider linking to search results instead of specific products.
