## 🔧 Tracking Improvements Needed

### Critical: Add UTM Parameters to Links
Currently unable to track which device pages drive conversions.

**Action:** Update all affiliate links to include UTM parameters:
```
https://amazon.com/s?k=ProGrade+SDXC&tag=sd-cc-20&utm_source=sdcardchecker&utm_medium=device-page&utm_campaign=device-name
```

**Parameters to track:**
- `utm_source` = sdcardchecker
- `utm_medium` = device-page | tool-page | guide | calculator
- `utm_campaign` = Device name (e.g., "canon-r6-mark-ii", "gopro-hero-13")

### Implementation
1. Add UTM builder to link generation system
2. Update all 98+ device pages with unique UTM codes
3. Track in Google Analytics 4 → Conversions → Source

### Dashboard Items to Monitor
- [ ] Which device pages drive most conversions?
- [ ] Device vs Tool vs Guide conversion rates
- [ ] Average order value by category
- [ ] Return rate (if available from Amazon)

### Active Networks

| OneLink | ⏳ Pending | Varies | Not yet used |

3. **Negotiate higher rates** - Once traffic increases, approach Amazon for higher tier
