        <p class="text-amber-900"><strong>Disclosure:</strong> SD Card Checker contains affiliate links. When you purchase through our links, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This disclosure is made in accordance with the FTC Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a commission when you click through and make a purchase. When you see product recommendations on SD Card Checker, many of them contain affiliate links to retailers such as Amazon.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">How We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">SD Card Checker recommends products based on careful research and testing. When we recommend a product that is available through an affiliate program, we use our affiliate link. This allows us to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Earn revenue to support ongoing website maintenance and improvements</li>
          <li>Continue providing free, high-quality research and recommendations</li>
          <li>Expand our product testing and comparison capabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Cost to You</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">You will pay the same price whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the retailer. Affiliate commissions do not increase the cost of products to you. In fact, when you use our links, you help support independent research and honest product recommendations.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Our Honest Recommendations</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">We only recommend products we genuinely believe are good choices for the intended purpose. Our recommendations are based on:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Technical specifications and device compatibility requirements</li>
          <li>User reviews and real-world performance feedback</li>
          <li>Brand reputation and reliability</li>
          <li>Value for money across different price points</li>
          <li>Our own knowledge and experience with SD card products</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">The fact that a product is available through an affiliate program does not influence whether or how we recommend it. If a non-affiliated product is superior, we will recommend it regardless of our ability to earn a commission.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Affiliated Programs</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">SD Card Checker participates in affiliate programs with:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Amazon Associates (amazon.com)</li>
          <li>Other relevant retail partners</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your Privacy</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">When you click on our affiliate links, your shopping experience remains private and secure. We do not receive your personal information, payment details, or account credentials. Your privacy is important to us. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information about how we handle your data.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Disclosure</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">As SD Card Checker evolves and adds new product categories or affiliate programs, we may update this disclosure. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed about our affiliate relationships.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Questions?</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700">If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or this disclosure, please contact us through our contact page.</p>
