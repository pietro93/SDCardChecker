                What's the difference between SD, SDHC, and SDXC?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">SD, SDHC, and SDXC are different standards for SD cards. SD cards hold up to 2GB, SDHC holds 4-32GB, and SDXC holds 32GB to 2TB. Most modern devices use SDXC cards. Check your device manual to see which type it supports.</p>

                What's the difference between SD and microSD?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">SD and microSD cards have the same technology but different physical sizes. SD cards are full-size (32×24mm) used in cameras and larger devices. microSD cards are much smaller (15×11mm) used in phones, drones, and action cameras. microSD cards often come with adapters to use as full-size SD cards.</p>

                Can I use a faster SD card in a slower device?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, absolutely. Speed ratings are minimum guarantees, not maximums. A U3 card works in any device that needs U1. You simply won't see the speed benefit if the device can't utilize the faster speeds. It's always safe to use a faster card.</p>
            </div>

                How much storage do I actually need?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Storage needs depend on your usage. For casual photography: 32-64GB is fine. For 4K video: 64-256GB depending on how much you record. Gaming consoles: 256GB-512GB for multiple games. Remember that actual usable space is about 5-10% less than advertised due to formatting.</p>

                Will an SDXC card work in my older camera?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Not always. Older devices only support SDHC. Before buying an SDXC card, check your device manual or specifications. Many professional and mirrorless cameras do support SDXC, but some older models don't.</p>

                What microSD card works with Nintendo Switch?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Nintendo Switch works with microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards up to 2TB. A U3 V30 card is recommended for faster game loading. The original Switch and Switch Lite work the same way.</p>

              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Most Android phones use microSD cards if they have expandable storage. The latest iPhones don't support microSD cards. Check your phone's specifications or manual to see if it supports expandable storage.</p>

              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, SD cards are device-agnostic. You can move the same card between your camera, drone, phone, and gaming console. Just remember to back up your data when moving cards between devices.</p>

                What does U3 mean?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">U3 is a UHS Speed Class rating that guarantees a minimum sustained write speed of 30 MB/s. This is sufficient for most 4K video recording. The "U" stands for UHS and the "3" means the third tier of performance.</p>
            </div>

                What does V30 mean?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">V30 is a Video Speed Class rating that guarantees a minimum sustained write speed of 30 MB/s specifically for video recording. It's equivalent to U3 for video purposes. Professional videographers often require V30 or higher.</p>
            </div>

                Do I need UHS-II or UHS-III?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">UHS-II and UHS-III provide faster data transfer speeds to your computer but don't affect recording performance. UHS-I is fine for most users. Professional photographers and videographers may benefit from UHS-II or UHS-III for faster file transfers.</p>
            </div>

                Why is my SD card slower than advertised?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Advertised speeds are typically maximum speeds, not sustained speeds. Real-world speeds depend on the device, file types, and usage. USB connection speed also affects file transfer speeds to your computer. Speed class ratings (U3, V30) guarantee minimum sustained speeds.</p>

              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Keep your SD card in a protective case. Store it in a cool, dry place away from extreme temperatures, moisture, and magnetic fields. Always use proper ejection procedures when removing the card from a device. Avoid dropping or bending the card.</p>

                How long do SD cards last?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">SD cards have no moving parts and can last 10+ years if properly cared for. However, they do have a limited number of write cycles (typically 10,000+). For important data, always keep backups rather than relying solely on the SD card.</p>
            </div>

                Is it bad to leave my SD card in the device?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">It's generally fine to leave your SD card in the device, especially if it's powered off. However, for long-term storage (months or years), remove the card and store it separately in a protective case. This prevents accidental damage or data corruption.</p>
            </div>

                What's the difference between a card reader and device transfer?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Card readers connect directly to your computer and are usually faster for transferring files. Device transfer (via USB) goes through the device's port and can be slower. Using a card reader is recommended for faster transfers and reduced wear on device ports.</p>

              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Buy from authorized retailers like Amazon, B&H Photo, or manufacturer websites. Be suspicious of prices that seem too good to be true. Counterfeit cards may work initially but fail quickly. Check seller ratings and reviews.</p>

              </h3>
              <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">Not always. Most users need only a mid-range card with U3/V30 rating. Premium cards with UHS-II/III are only necessary if you transfer huge video files frequently. For casual use, a good U3 card from a trusted brand offers the best value.</p>
            </div>
