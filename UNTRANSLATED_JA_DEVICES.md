- **Also has**: English FAQ

### 9. **Orange Pi 5**
- **Field**: whySpecs
- **English text**: "Features a unique dual microSD slot design: one dedicated for the operating system (like EmuELEC or Android) and another for game ROMs. The OS card benefits significantly from an A2 application performance rating for faster boot times, smoother menu navigation, and quicker application loading. The game card can be a standard U1/Class 10 card, as most retro games load quickly even from slightly slower media."

### 10. **Potensic Atom SE**
- **Line**: 5691
- **Field**: whySpecs

- **Line**: 5733
- **Field**: whySpecs
