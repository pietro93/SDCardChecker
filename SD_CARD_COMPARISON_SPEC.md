## 🛠️ TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Data Source
- Pull from `/data/sdcards.json` (already populated with 30+ cards)
- Extend schema with optional fields (readSpeed, capacity, etc.)

### Rendering
- Static generation (build-time): Pre-generate popular comparisons
- Dynamic (fetch): Allow custom card selection
- Hybrid: Pre-generate top 10 comparisons, allow custom on-page

### Performance
- Lazy-load card images
- Comparison table: ~2KB data per card (acceptable)
- Target page load: <1 second on 3G

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Screen reader friendly: table structure, alt text
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through cards, arrow keys to switch
- Color contrast: Don't rely solely on color for "recommended" badges

## 📝 OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Should we show user reviews/ratings on comparison pages? (requires external API or manual curation)
2. Should we include capacity options in comparison? (e.g., "SanDisk Extreme 128GB vs 256GB")
3. Should we generate custom comparison pages for [Card A] vs [Card B] combinations dynamically, or only pre-generate popular ones?
4. Should comparison pages show price ranges (varies by capacity) or fixed prices?
5. Should we include "in-stock" status from Amazon affiliates?
