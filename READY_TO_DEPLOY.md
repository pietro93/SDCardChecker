## Before Going Live - Checklist

- [ ] Test locally: `npm start`
- [ ] Verify all device pages load
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test Amazon links work
- [ ] Replace affiliate tag if customizing

- [ ] Deploy to production

## Monetization - It's Ready

Your site already has:

✅ Amazon affiliate links embedded  
✅ Proper affiliate disclosure  
✅ High-converting device pages  
✅ Clear call-to-actions  

Just replace `AFFILIATETAG` with your actual Amazon Associates tag.

## Test Locally First

```bash
npm start
```

- [ ] Amazon links visible
- [ ] Mobile view responsive

## Getting Your Domain

1. Buy domain at: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains
2. Point to your Vercel/Netlify hosting
3. SSL/HTTPS automatically enabled

Or skip this - your deployment gives you a free `.vercel.app` or `.netlify.app` domain.

## One More Thing...

Your site is **static** - meaning:
- ✅ No database needed
- ✅ No server to maintain
- ✅ Scales to millions of visitors
- ✅ Cost is basically free (~$0-10/month)
- ✅ Lightning fast globally
- ✅ Secure by default

This is the best architecture for this use case.

## You're Ready!

```bash
npm start              # View locally
npm run build          # Generate site
vercel                 # Deploy to production
```

That's it. You're live.
