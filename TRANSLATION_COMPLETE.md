## Next Steps

The Japanese FAQ translation for devices is now **83% complete** with 117 out of 140 devices having FAQs. The remaining 23 devices without FAQs are primarily computing devices (iPhones, iPads, laptops, etc.) that either:
1. Don't have FAQs in the English version
2. Use external USB readers rather than internal SD card slots
3. Have minimal configuration requirements

If you need FAQs for the remaining devices, they can be manually created using the same patterns established for similar device categories.
