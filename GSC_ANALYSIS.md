## 💡 Opportunities Identified

### Content Gaps (0 CTR Despite Impressions)

**Osmo Pocket 3 & Mini 4 Pro:**
- Getting 20+ impressions on requirements/specs queries
- 0% CTR suggests our answer box isn't matching intent
- **Possible fix:** 
  - Ensure first FAQ answer explicitly states "requirements"
  - Make answer scannable (bullet points for spec requirements)
  - Verify title/description match query intent

**Steam Deck:**
- Similar pattern: 10+ impressions, 0% CTR
- Users searching for "specs" and "recommended" variants
- Action: Review page structure for answer box optimization

### New Devices to Add (High Search Demand)

**No new devices found yet in GSC queries.** All impressions are for devices we already have. This is good - means:
- Our dataset is relevant
- No obvious gaps yet
- Monitor for emerging device patterns

---

## 🟢 Success Case: Raspberry Pi 5

**Why it won the 1 click:**
- Query: "best sd card for raspberry pi 5"
- Our new title format includes "Best SD Cards for"
- This query exactly matches our title template
- Answer box likely clear and scannable

**Learning:** "Best SD Cards for [Device]" title format works for this query pattern.

## 🎯 Critical Insight: Osmo Pocket 3 Page Issue

**The Problem:**
- **168 GA4 impressions** (20% of all organic traffic to device pages)
- **20 GSC query variations** with 5 impressions each
- **0 clicks** from Osmo Pocket 3 queries
- **2 active users** actually engaged with the page

This is our #1 priority. The page is getting visibility but NOT converting searches into clicks.

**Why:** 
- Users are searching "dji osmo pocket 3 [memory/sd/microsd] [requirements/specs/recommendations]"
- Our page title/description or answer box isn't matching this intent
- Raspberry Pi 5 page works because query format matches title exactly

**Action:** Review DJI Osmo Pocket 3 page:
1. Check answer box clarity (first FAQ answer)
2. Verify title is being indexed with correct keywords
3. Make sure spec requirements are prominently displayed
4. Consider adding dedicated "Requirements" section before FAQs

---

## ⚠️ Next Steps

1. **FIX Osmo Pocket 3 page** (highest impact - 20% of traffic)
2. **Review Mini 4 Pro & Steam Deck** (11% traffic each)
3. **Wait for re-indexing** (titles changed Nov 15, Google needs 3-7 days to update)
4. **Study Raspberry Pi 5 page** - document what's working
5. **Collect more data** - Nov 22 review to see if title changes help
