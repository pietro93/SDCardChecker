## 🎯 EXPERT ANALYSIS: UX & SEO Assessment (REVISED)

### Overall Health Check: 9-DAY LAUNCH

**VERDICT: Strong visibility signals from Google, but low CTR indicates a SERP appeal problem + new site trust deficit. Not a page quality issue—a feedback loop where low CTR on SERP reinforces Google's initial skepticism.**

#### Critical Discovery: The Mobile-First Conversion Engine

| Device | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Insight |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|---------|
| **Desktop** | 3,179 | 8 | **0.25%** | 🔴 Google "testing" your pages |
| **Mobile** | 1,276 | 18 | **1.41%** | 🟢 **5.6x better conversion** |
| **Tablet** | 27 | 0 | 0% | Ignore |

**Critical Finding:** Mobile users are 5.6x more likely to click your result than desktop users. This is not a quirk—it's your competitive advantage. Mobile-optimized pages + quick-loading answers are resonating.

#### The Real Problem: Not Page Quality, But the Feedback Loop

1. **Google shows your page** (relevance algorithm is working)
2. **Users don't click** (SERP snippet/positioning is unattractive OR answer box prevents clicks)
3. **Google interprets low CTR as quality signal** (treats it as "users think this is a poor result")
4. **Google shows your page less often** (positive feedback loop inverted)

This is **not** a content problem. Your pages are relevant. The problem is they're losing the "battle for the click" on the SERP.

**Score Card (Revised):**
- **Search Visibility:** ✅ Excellent (Google is giving you thousands of impressions)
- **SERP Appeal:** ⚠️ Unknown (must verify manually—see action items)
- **Mobile Experience:** 🟢 **Exceptional** (5.6x better than desktop)
- **New Site Authority:** 🔴 Expected deficit (will improve with time + backlinks)

### Problem 1: THE TRAFFIC BLACK HOLE (1,320 impressions = 29% of all traffic)

**Pages getting 100+ impressions with 0-1 clicks:**
1. DJI Osmo Pocket 3: 390 impressions → 1 click (0.26% CTR)
2. DJI Osmo Action 4: 223 impressions → 0 clicks
3. Steam Deck: 206 impressions → 0 clicks
4. DJI Mini 4 Pro: 199 impressions → 0 clicks
5. Sony FX30: 167 impressions → 0 clicks
6. Sony A6700: 135 impressions → 0 clicks

#### Hypothesis 1: Answer Boxes Are Stealing Clicks (LIKELY BUT UNPROVEN)

**Evidence:**
- 95% of your top queries are informational: "requirements," "specs," "compatibility"
- Google favors Featured Snippets for these query types
- Featured snippets eliminate CTR for the result itself

**Counter-evidence needed:**
- Manual SERP analysis required (see action items below)

#### Hypothesis 2: Your SERP Snippet Is Unattractive (LIKELY BUT UNPROVEN)

**Evidence:**
- Title/meta descriptions are likely generic or auto-generated
- New sites rarely win the visual "battle for the click"

**Counter-evidence needed:**
- Check Google Search Console "Search Appearance" to see what Google is displaying
- Manual SERP inspection

#### Hypothesis 3: YouTube/Retailers Are Dominant Results (POSSIBLE)

**Evidence:**
- For mainstream devices (DJI, Steam Deck, Canon), YouTube reviews dominate
- Amazon product pages rank high due to authority + user reviews

**Counter-evidence needed:**
- Manual SERP inspection for your top 10 queries

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED (Before Any Changes)

**You must manually inspect the SERPs to prove/disprove these hypotheses.** Changes based on wrong assumptions waste time.

**Process:**
1. Open Incognito window
2. Set region: United States
3. Search: `dji osmo pocket 3 sd card requirements`
4. Document:
   - Is there a Featured Snippet? If yes, who owns it?
   - What are positions #1-5?
   - Is your site showing? If yes, in what position?
5. Repeat for: `steam deck sd card`, `dji mini 4 pro microsd`, `sony a6700 sd card`
6. Share screenshots/findings

**Once you have this data, the optimization strategy will be clear.**

### Problem 2: THE DESKTOP vs MOBILE PARADOX (New Discovery)

**Your actual performance tells the story:**

| Channel | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Reality |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----|---------|
| Desktop | 3,179 | 8 | 0.25% | Google showing but users not clicking |
| Mobile | 1,276 | 18 | 1.41% | **5.6x higher conversion** |

**Why this matters:** 
- Desktop is Google "testing" your pages (low trust, broad impressions)
- Mobile users who find you actually click you (high trust, engaged audience)
- **Action:** Prioritize mobile experience in all optimizations

---

### Problem 3: THE NICHE PARADOX (Lower Traffic = Higher Conversions - CONFIRMED)

**Winners with <100 impressions but 2-25% CTR:**
- Leica Q3-43: 7 impressions → 1 click (14.29% CTR)
- Miyoo Mini Plus: 43 impressions → 1 click (2.33% CTR)
- Canon R6 Mark II: 128 impressions → 2 clicks (1.56% CTR)

**Why niche wins over mass-market:**

**Niche audience (Leica buyers):**
- High intent: "I'm buying a Leica Q3-43, what SD card should I get?"
- Fewer competing answers (manufacturer specs are often vague)
- Our detailed comparison = premium positioning

**Mass-market audience (DJI Mini 4 Pro buyers):**
- Mixed intent: Some checking, some already bought, some still deciding
- Hundreds of competing answers (YouTube reviews, Reddit, Amazon)
- Our page isn't positioning as "the" authority vs noise

**UX Implication:** Your competitive advantage is **niche expertise**, not mass-market guides. Lean into this.

### Problem 4: MOBILE DOMINANCE (18 of 26 clicks = 69%)

**Good News:** Your site is clearly mobile-optimized and users prefer it.
**Action:** Don't over-optimize for desktop. Mobile is your lane.

## 🔬 REVISED ACTION PLAN: Hypothesis-Driven Testing

### Phase 1: Proof (Next 2-3 Days)

**1️⃣ MANUAL SERP INSPECTION (Required)**
- Search 10 key terms in incognito (US region)
- Document exact SERP layout, featured snippets, competitor positions
- **Deliverable:** Screenshots + findings to inform Phase 2 strategy

**2️⃣ GSC "SEARCH APPEARANCE" AUDIT**
- Check what title/meta Google is actually showing for your pages
- Identify any auto-generated descriptions (sign of weak meta)
- **Deliverable:** List of pages needing title/meta optimization

**3️⃣ MOBILE PERFORMANCE DEEP DIVE**
- Why is mobile 5.6x better? (Faster load? Better UX? Different user intent?)
- Test your top pages on mobile (Chrome DevTools)
- Check Core Web Vitals
- **Deliverable:** Mobile optimization opportunities identified

### Phase 2: Targeted Fixes (Based on Phase 1 Data)

**IF Featured Snippets are the problem:**
- Create scannable, snippet-friendly answer sections
- Target featured snippet format (list, table, definition)
- Focus on mobile presentation

**IF Your SERP appearance is weak:**
- Rewrite title tags to be more compelling
- Craft unique meta descriptions that answer the query immediately
- Add schema markup for better SERP display

**IF YouTube/retailers are ranking #1:**
- Don't fight them on this query
- Find adjacent, less-competitive queries to target
- Focus optimization effort on niche markets where you can win

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 2+)

**Double down on what works:**
- Add 20-30 niche device pages (Leica variants, premium cameras, retro gaming handhelds)
- Build backlinks (outreach to tech blogs, review sites)
- Create content for lower-competition queries in your winning categories

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE UX/SEO PRIORITY FIXES (Conditional on Phase 1 Results)

### 1️⃣ FIX THE ANSWER BOX (Recover 15-20 clicks)

**For:** DJI Mini 4 Pro, Steam Deck, DJI Osmo Pocket 3

**Action:**
```html
<!-- Add this BEFORE the main H1 -->
<div class="answer-box" style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Quick Answer</h2>
  <p><strong>DJI Mini 4 Pro requires:</strong></p>
  <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
    <li>UHS-II SD card</li>
    <li>128GB capacity recommended</li>
    <li>V30 or V60 speed class</li>
    <li>Read speed: 90 MB/s minimum</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

**Why:** This matches the exact format Google uses for featured snippets. Users scanning results see the answer immediately.

### 2️⃣ SCHEMA MARKUP ADDITION (Help Google understand what we offer)

**Add to every device page:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "DJI Mini 4 Pro SD Card Requirements",
  "description": "Compatible SD card specifications for DJI Mini 4 Pro",
  "isPartOf": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "name": "SD Card Checker"
  },
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "DJI"
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Google can show richer snippets. Better positioning in SERPs.

### 3️⃣ META DESCRIPTION AUDIT (Control your SERP snippet)

**Current issue:** Meta descriptions likely aren't being used.

**Fix:** Write unique 160-character descriptions for top 20 devices:

```
❌ Bad: "Find SD card requirements for DJI Mini 4 Pro"
✅ Good: "DJI Mini 4 Pro: Requires UHS-II SD card, 128GB, V60 class. Complete compatibility guide & recommendations."
```

**Devices to fix first:** DJI Osmo Pocket 3, DJI Mini 4 Pro, Steam Deck, Sony A6700

### 4️⃣ INTERNAL LINKING FIX (Keep users on your site)

**Current issue:** No mention of internal links in GSC data. Check if device pages link to:
- Speed classes page (currently 0% CTR despite 71 impressions)
- Other device pages
- SD card comparison tools

**Fix:** Add 2-3 internal links per device page

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING (Pages Converting at 1.5%+ CTR)

**Analysis of winners:**

| Device | CTR | Why It Works | Pattern |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| Leica Q3-43 | 14.29% | Premium niche, fewer competitors | Luxury market |
| Miyoo Mini Plus | 2.33% | Retro gaming enthusiasts, dedicated audience | Hobbyist market |
| Canon R6 Mark II | 1.56% | Professional photographers, high intent | Professional market |
| Lenovo Legion Go | 1.52% | Gaming handheld, emerging market | New product market |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | 1.61% | Developers/makers, specific specs | Technical market |
| Fujifilm XT5 | 3.75% | Camera enthusiasts, specs matter | Enthusiast market |

**Pattern:** **All winners target niche, high-intent audiences with specific needs.** Your competitive advantage is NOT competing with Amazon/Best Buy for mass-market buyers. It's being the go-to guide for people with specific, technical device requirements.

---

## ❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING (0% CTR Despite 100+ Impressions)

**Devices with mass-market appeal:**
- DJI drones (consumer hobby market)
- Steam Deck (mainstream gaming)
- Sony A6700 (popular camera)
- Canon G7X Mark III (bestselling compact)

**Why?** These devices are too mainstream. Users see 20 other results and don't click yours because:
1. They're buying from Amazon/B&H (showing purchase prices)
2. They're watching YouTube reviews
3. They found the answer in an answer box already

**UX Reality:** You can't out-compete big retailers on these. Accept it. Focus on the niches where you WIN.

## 🌍 LANGUAGE LOCALIZATION STRATEGY

### Market Opportunity Analysis

| Language | Search Volume | Monetization | Market Difficulty | Timeline | ROI |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-----|
| 🇯🇵 **Japanese** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ MASSIVE | ✅ Journey/Mediavine* | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HARD | 12+ mo | 🟢 **BEST** |
| 🇸🇪 **Swedish** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH | ✅ Mediavine + OneLink | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM | 6-9 mo | 🟢 **STRONG** |
| 🇳🇱 **Dutch** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH | ✅ Mediavine + OneLink | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM | 6-9 mo | 🟢 **STRONG** |
| 🇩🇪 German | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH | ✅ Mediavine + OneLink | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM | 6-9 mo | 🟡 GOOD |
| 🇫🇷 French | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM | ✅ Mediavine + OneLink | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM | 6-9 mo | 🟡 GOOD |
| 🇪🇸 Spanish | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH | ✅ Mediavine + OneLink | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HARD | 9-12 mo | 🟡 OKAY |

**Legend:** *Journey/Mediavine requires alternative affiliate solution (Rakuten, local networks)

### Recommended Sequence (Timeline)

**Phase 1: Build English Authority (Now - 6 months)**
- Focus all SEO energy on English site
- Get backlinks, build domain rating
- Target: 1000+ sessions/month from English
- **Why:** Easier to expand once you have authority

**Phase 2: Swedish + Dutch (Month 6-9)**
- Both have high Mediavine RPM + OneLink coverage
- Smaller competition pools = faster ranking
- Investment: ~30% of English effort → 60-70% of revenue
- **Why:** Best ROI per unit of effort

**Phase 3: German (Month 9-12)**
- Large market, established shopping culture
- Similar monetization to English
- Investment: ~40% of English effort → 75%+ of revenue

**Phase 4: Japanese (Month 12+)**
- Highest volume market
- **Critical blocker:** Need to solve affiliate monetization
- Options: Rakuten Ads (lower commission), Mediavive Journey only, wait for Amazon Japan Associates approval

### Action Items for Now

1. **Do NOT localize yet** - Focus on English authority
2. **Monitor Japan traffic** - If it remains high (100+ impr/week), prioritize solving affiliate problem by Month 6
3. **Track Sweden/Netherlands search volume** - If they show up in GSC consistently, plan Swedish translation by Month 6
4. **Document:** Bookmark this section for Month 6 planning

## 🎯 REVISED STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS (Data-Driven)

### Finding #1: Mobile is Your Competitive Advantage
- Mobile CTR: 1.41% vs Desktop 0.25%
- **Action:** Design all optimizations mobile-first. Test mobile before desktop.
- **Why:** Your audience is mobile-native. Lean into it.

### Finding #2: Niche Markets Are Your Moat
**Data proves it:**
- Leica Q3-43: 14.29% CTR (luxury market)
- Miyoo Mini Plus: 2.33% CTR (hobbyist market)
- Fujifilm XT5: 3.75% CTR (enthusiast market)

**vs. Mass-market:**
- DJI Osmo Pocket 3: 0.26% CTR (consumer market)
- Steam Deck: 0% CTR (mainstream market)

**Action:** Prioritize adding 20-30 niche device pages:
- Leica variants (Q2, M11, D-Lux 8)
- Retro gaming handhelds (Anbernic, Retroid)
- Premium mirrorless (high-end Canon, Nikon, Sony)
- Computing/maker devices (Raspberry Pi variants)

**Don't waste effort:** Stop trying to rank #1 for DJI/Steam Deck. You can't beat Amazon + YouTube on these. Your advantage is serving underserved niches.

### Finding #3: The Real CTR Problem Remains Unknown
- ⚠️ Featured Snippets? Unproven
- ⚠️ Weak SERP appearance? Likely but unconfirmed
- ⚠️ YouTube dominance? Possible

**Next step:** Complete the SERP inspection to identify the actual blocker before making changes.

## 🎯 Critical Insights from Page-Level Data

### Pattern #1: Smaller Audience = Better CTR
**Fujifilm X100VI, Miyoo Mini Plus, Leica Q3-43 show 7-25% CTR**
- These pages have lower impression volume (4-13 impressions)
- But they convert at 5-10x the rate of high-volume pages
- **Hypothesis:** Niche queries are more intent-driven; generic "requirements" queries are less

### Pattern #2: High Volume, Zero Conversion (RED FLAG)
**DJI Mini 4 Pro (171 impressions, 0%) and Steam Deck (167 impressions, 0%)**
- These are #2 and #3 highest traffic pages
- Getting massive organic visibility but ZERO clicks
- **Root cause likely:** Page content doesn't match search intent well enough
- These pages need immediate optimization

### Pattern #3: Canon R6 Mark II Success
**Only page with 2+ clicks (2 clicks from 95 impressions = 2.1%)**
- This is the highest converting high-volume page
- What's working on this page that DJI Mini 4 Pro isn't?
- **Action:** Study Canon R6 Mark II page structure for replication

### Pattern #4: Category Pages Getting Traffic But No Conversions
- /categories/mirrorless-cameras/ → 0 clicks from 2 impressions
- /categories/security-cameras/ → 0 clicks from 1 impression
- /categories/computing-and-tablets/ → 0 clicks from 2 impressions
- **Note:** These shouldn't be getting traffic since we unified to /categories/cameras/
- Check if old category pages still being indexed

   - "uhs-i speed grade 3" (1 impression) - Technical spec search, potential SEO opportunity

6. **NEW GAME CONSOLE/DEVICE:**
   - "rog ally x sd card compatibility" (1 click!) - **WINNING PAGE**
   - Already getting conversions despite limited visibility

### 🎯 Critical Insights - Device Gap Analysis

**IMMEDIATE ADDITIONS NEEDED (Getting 2+ impressions):**
1. **Lenovo Legion Go** - 4+ combined search queries
   - Variations: "Legion Go", "Legion Go S", "Legion Go 2"
   - Search intent: Handheld gaming + SD card specs
   - Priority: **CRITICAL** - Multiple distinct queries, zero pages

2. **Fujifilm X-T50** - 2 impressions
   - New camera model, getting visibility
   - We have X100VI but not X-T50
   - Priority: **HIGH**

3. **Canon EOS R50** - 2+ impressions
   - We may have R6 Mark II but not R50
   - Priority: **HIGH**

**ADD THIS WEEK (1-2 impressions, high intent):**
4. **Nikon Z50 II** - 2 impressions
   - Mirrorless, mid-range, specific search intent
5. **Sony FX30** - 2 impressions  
   - Cinema camera, high-value queries
6. **Insta360 X4** - 1+ impressions
   - Action camera, emerging product
7. **Insta360 Ace Pro** - 1 impression
   - Action camera variant
8. **Leica D-Lux 8** - 1 impression
   - Premium compact camera, high CTR potential
9. **Fujifilm X100V** - 1 impression variant (we have VI, need V)
10. **Canon PowerShot G7X Mark II** - 1 impression
   - Premium compact, niche audience
11. **Nikon D7500** - 1 impression
   - DSLR, older but still relevant
12. **Nikon ZF** - 1 impression
   - New Nikon mount, needs coverage
13. **DJI Mini 3** - 1+ impressions
   - Older DJI model, still getting searches (we have Mini 4 Pro, Mini 4K)

**SPECIAL CASE:**
- **Legion Go (all variants)** should be treated as 3 separate devices or 1 device with variant options due to different SD card specs

### 🚀 NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES

**ROG Ally X Success:** Got 1 click on "rog ally x sd card compatibility" query - this validates the gaming handheld market is converting. **Legion Go family will likely perform even better** (higher search volume = 4 impressions vs 1).

**Action Camera Resurgence:** DJI Mini 4K and action camera queries are increasing. These devices have HIGH specs requirements (UHS-II, V60+) which means higher-value SD card purchases.

**Specialty Camera Market:** Leica, high-end Fujifilm, Canon EOS series - these niche products get fewer impressions but tend to convert better (high-intent users).

### 📸 Hero Image Status & Action Items

All devices currently use fallback placeholders (no custom imageUrl in devices.json). Devices with HIGH and MEDIUM priority should get custom hero images.

| Device Page | Clicks | Impressions | Image Status | Priority | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DJI Osmo Pocket 3** | 1 | 43 | 🔴 Placeholder | **CRITICAL** | CREATE - Most impressions, no custom image |
| **Sony FX3** | 1 | 18 | 🔴 Sony placeholder | **HIGH** | CREATE - Premium camera, important for CTR |
| **Nikon Z8** | 1 | 16 | ✅ Custom image | DONE | Monitoring |
| Canon EOS R6 Mark II | 1 | 10 | 🔴 Canon placeholder | MEDIUM | CREATE when possible |
| Fujifilm X100VI | 1 | 5 | 🔴 Fujifilm placeholder | MEDIUM | CREATE when possible |
| Leica Q3-43 | 1 | 4 | 🔴 Sony placeholder | LOW | CREATE when possible |
| Miyoo Mini Plus | 1 | 3 | 🔴 Gaming placeholder | LOW | CREATE when possible |
| **DJI Mini 4 Pro** | 0 | 98 | ✅ Custom image | DONE | Most impressions - has image |
| **Steam Deck** | 0 | 96 | ✅ Custom image | DONE | Gaming, has image |
| **Sony A6700** | 0 | 46 | ✅ Custom image | DONE | Cameras, has image |
| Nintendo Switch Lite | 0 | 36 | 🔴 Gaming placeholder | MEDIUM | CREATE when possible |
| ASUS ROG Ally | 0 | 33 | ✅ Custom image | DONE | Gaming, has image |
| GoPro Hero 13 | 0 | 30 | ✅ Custom image | DONE | Action cam, has image |

**Key Finding:** DJI Osmo Pocket 3 (43 impressions, 1 click = 2.33% CTR) and Sony FX3 (18 impressions, 1 click = 5.56% CTR) are missing custom images despite high traffic. These should be top priority.

## 💡 Opportunities Identified

### Content Gaps (0 CTR Despite Impressions)

**Osmo Pocket 3 & Mini 4 Pro:**
- Getting 20+ impressions on requirements/specs queries
- 0% CTR suggests our answer box isn't matching intent
- **Possible fix:** 
  - Ensure first FAQ answer explicitly states "requirements"
  - Make answer scannable (bullet points for spec requirements)
  - Verify title/description match query intent

**Steam Deck:**
- Similar pattern: 10+ impressions, 0% CTR
- Users searching for "specs" and "recommended" variants
- Action: Review page structure for answer box optimization

### New Devices to Add (High Search Demand)

**No new devices found yet in GSC queries.** All impressions are for devices we already have. This is good - means:
- Our dataset is relevant
- No obvious gaps yet
- Monitor for emerging device patterns

---

## 🟢 Success Case: Raspberry Pi 5

**Why it won the 1 click:**
- Query: "best sd card for raspberry pi 5"
- Our new title format includes "Best SD Cards for"
- This query exactly matches our title template
- Answer box likely clear and scannable

**Learning:** "Best SD Cards for [Device]" title format works for this query pattern.

## 🎯 Critical Insight: Osmo Pocket 3 Page Issue

**The Problem:**
- **168 GA4 impressions** (20% of all organic traffic to device pages)
- **20 GSC query variations** with 5 impressions each
- **0 clicks** from Osmo Pocket 3 queries
- **2 active users** actually engaged with the page

This is our #1 priority. The page is getting visibility but NOT converting searches into clicks.

**Why:** 
- Users are searching "dji osmo pocket 3 [memory/sd/microsd] [requirements/specs/recommendations]"
- Our page title/description or answer box isn't matching this intent
- Raspberry Pi 5 page works because query format matches title exactly

**Action:** Review DJI Osmo Pocket 3 page:
1. Check answer box clarity (first FAQ answer)
2. Verify title is being indexed with correct keywords
3. Make sure spec requirements are prominently displayed
4. Consider adding dedicated "Requirements" section before FAQs

### Queries Getting Most Impression Bulk (2+ impressions)

1. **"best sd card for lenovo legion go s"** (2) ✅ Converting
2. **"mini 4 pro sd card requirements"** (2)
3. **"dji mini 3 maximum sd card size"** (2)
4. **"dji mini 4k memory card type"** (2)
5. **"lenovo legion go sd card speed"** (2) ✅ Converting

**Observation:** DJI products dominating query volume but NOT converting. Legion Go converting despite lower overall volume suggests **intent/clarity matters more than traffic volume**.

### Critical Issue - Category Pages Still Showing

Old category pages appearing in GSC:
- `/categories/action-cameras/dji-osmo-pocket-3/` (1 impression)
- `/categories/gaming-handhelds/miyoo-mini-plus/` (1 impression)

## ⚡ UPDATED QUICK ACTION PLAN (Nov 18)

**VERIFICATION NEEDED (Next 2 hours):**
1. Check if Legion Go, Nikon Z50 II, Leica Q2, Panasonic S9/S5 IIx have custom hero images
   - These are converting despite potential image gaps
   - Determine if images helped or if content clarity is the real factor

2. Check old category page redirects
   - Are `/categories/action-cameras/dji-osmo-pocket-3/` etc redirecting to `/devices/dji-osmo-pocket-3/`?
   - If not, create 301 redirects

**THIS WEEK (High-volume, 0% CTR devices):**
1. **Sony FX3** (33 impressions, 0% CTR)
   - Review answer box clarity
   - Compare with Nikon Z50 II success structure (11.11% CTR)
   
2. **DJI Mini 4K** (29 impressions, 0% CTR)
   - Common query: "dji mini 4k memory card type"
   - Ensure title/first answer explicitly states the card type required

3. **Canon G7X Mark III** (17 impressions, 0% CTR)
   - Compare with Leica Q2 (14.29% CTR)
   - Both are premium compacts - why the difference?

**HYPOTHESIS ON CONVERTERS:**
Premium/niche devices (Leica, Panasonic, Nikon Z-series) convert better because:
- Search intent is clearer (users know what they want)
- Fewer competing results
- Our pages likely match the specific, narrow search queries better
- Smaller audience = higher engagement when found

DJI/Canon/Sony mid-range devices get high volume but low conversion because:
- Broad search queries ("memory card type" vs "best sd card for")
- Users may not be ready to buy (still researching)
- Our answer boxes might be missing the "quick answer" format these queries expect

## 📝 Page Comparison Framework

To understand why Canon R6 Mark II converts and DJI Mini 4 Pro doesn't:

```html
Questions to investigate for each page:
1. Title format - does it match query intent?
2. First FAQ answer - is it scannable?
3. "Requirements" section - prominent and clear?
4. Hero image - does it exist and is it relevant?
5. Page structure - specs first or buried?
6. Call-to-action clarity - where to find SD cards?
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings So Far

1. **Page-level traffic ≠ clicks** - DJI Mini 4 Pro getting 10x more traffic than Canon R6 Mark II, but zero conversions vs 2 clicks
2. **Niche products convert better** - Fujifilm X100VI (7.69% CTR) vs DJI products (0%)
3. **Smaller audience, clearer intent** - 4-13 impression pages have 5-10x better CTR
4. **One page found the formula** - Canon R6 Mark II is our gold standard (2.1% CTR on high volume)
5. **Search traffic is real** - 1,693 impressions in 5 days validates product-market fit
